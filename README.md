## Setting up the virtual environment
There aren't a great deal of required packages. The bare necessities are stored in the `requirements.txt` and `environment.yml` files for `pip` and `conda` users respectively. Read on to learn how to install them!


### Conda
```
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

### Pip
```
conda create --name <new_environment_name> --file requirements.txt
```
